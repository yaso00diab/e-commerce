# Fresh-Cart

Fresh-Cart is an e-commerce web application that provides users with a seamless online shopping experience. This project was developed to showcase a modern, responsive, and fully functional shopping cart application, complete with user authentication, product browsing, and cart management features.

## Project Description
Fresh-Cart is built focusing on clean code, reusable components, and scalable architecture. The application allows users to browse various products, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. It also includes user authentication and account management functionalities.

## Features
* Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.
* Product Listing: Users can browse products categorized into various sections, view product details, and filter/search for specific items.
* Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration features, allowing users to manage their accounts and view order history.
* Order Management: Users can review their order history and track their orders.
## Technologies Used
* Front-end: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* State Management: React Context API
* Routing: React Router
* Back-end Integration: Real API for authentication and data storage
* Styling: CSS, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap
## Challenges Faced
* State Management: Managing the global state across multiple components and pages was a significant challenge. I overcame this by implementing the Context API to handle the state more efficiently.

* Responsive Design: Ensuring that the application remained visually appealing and functional on various devices required extensive testing and adjustments, particularly with CSS Grid and Flexbox.

* Authentication Integration: Integrating Firebase for user authentication presented some difficulties, particularly in handling asynchronous operations and ensuring secure user data management.

* Performance Optimization: Keeping the application performant, especially when dealing with large sets of product data, required careful optimization of React components and efficient use of React's rendering lifecycle methods.
